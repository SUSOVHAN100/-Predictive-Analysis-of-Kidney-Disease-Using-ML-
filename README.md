📘 Chronic Kidney Disease – EDA & Machine Learning Analysis
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the application of various Machine Learning models to analyze Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) data. The notebook includes cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and classification for predictive insights.

🚀 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading & Cleaning
Handled missing values

Converted object-type medical indicators into numerical values

Normalized/skewed features were processed

Label encoding for categorical variables

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution plots for features

Correlation heatmaps

Trend patterns

Boxplots & pairplots

Interactive visualizations using Plotly

3️⃣ Feature Scaling
Standardization using StandardScaler

4️⃣ Dimensionality Reduction
Applied PCA to visualize data in 2D/3D

5️⃣ Clustering
Implemented unsupervised learning methods:

KMeans

DBSCAN

Agglomerative Clustering
